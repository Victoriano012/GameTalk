You are evaluating a list of responses to determine whether each one sounds like something a human might naturally say in a conversation (Naturalness score).
These are isolated responses: you will not see the previous parts of the conversation. Your task is to judge whether each reply could plausibly be part of a natural, human dialogue.

Evaluate each response based on the following criteria:
Conversationality: Is it phrased like something a human would say in a casual or meaningful exchange?
Completeness: Is it more than a fragment or a single word? Does it express a complete thought?
Engagement: Does it show interest or effort to participate in the dialogue?

For each response, output Yes if it sounds like a valid conversational reply, and No if it does not.

Examples:

Response: "That could work, but I’d want to test a simpler version first."
Naturalness score: Yes

Response: "Maybe maybe maybe."
Naturalness score: No // Repetitive, unnatural

Response: "What do you think we should try next?"
Naturalness score: Yes

Response: "Sure."
Naturalness score: No // Too short, low effort

Response: "I’m still thinking about it, but I have a few ideas."
Naturalness score: Yes


Now evaluate the following responses:
